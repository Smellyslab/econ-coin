# econ-coin
A new http PoC non valuable crypto currency written in pure python3 (with a little bit of json) for beginners to crypto currency. It does not require high cpu or gpu usage mining software and has meh security. Though i dont think it should be used for commercial use, as it needs some improvements im sure. check out a live version of the coin here it is also the main / official website: https://econcoin.pythonanywhere.com/ // DO NOT GET SCAMMED IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SELL YOU THIS SOURCE CODE OR ECN ON THE LIVE OR THEIR OWN SITE IT IS A SCAM THESE COINS ARE NOT WORTH ANY MONEY AND SHOULD NOT BE AT ANY POINT!
And while yes i guess this can be used commercially, i wouldnt recommend it but you do you...
it says that little red x but dont worry it works just fine. 
to run just do
git clone https://github.com/Smellyslab/econ-coin/
cd econ-coin
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py 
and you have a fully functional http based cryptocurrency up and running on flask.

this coin was made to be instant. So transactions are all instant with a 10% network fee. so if you wanted to send someone 10 ECN it would cost you 11 ecn in total with the 10% fee. 
the reason this exists is to fund mining. 
so the second you make a transaction, it goes through and you get your money taken and they get theirs and you dont need to mine blocks to complete transactions.
```py
text = "Thanks for using ECN's source code!"
print(f"hey there was a message! it reads: {text}")
```
